# 🛡️ ISU Community Bot

> **Protecting and Serving the ISU Student Community on WhatsApp.**

This bot was built to address the specific challenges facing our student groups: targeting by spammers, malicious attacks, and the delay in accessing crucial information. It serves as an automated guardian and assistant, ensuring a safe and efficient environment for all students.

## 🚀 Why this exists
Our student groups were facing frequent spam attacks and moderation issues. Additionally, students often had to wait hours for admins to reply to simple queries. This bot solves both problems by:
1.  **Automating Security:** Instantly detecting and removing bad actors.
2.  **Automating Support:** Providing instant answers and resources 24/7.
